The relevance scores

By default, Elasticsearch sorts matching results by their relevance score, that is, by how well each document matches the query. The first and highest-scoring result is obvious: John Smith’s about field clearly says “rock climbing” in it.

But why did Jane Smith come back as a result? The reason her document was returned is because the word “rock” was mentioned in her about field. Because only “rock” was mentioned, and not “climbing,” her _score is lower than John’s.

This is a good example of how Elasticsearch can search within full-text fields and return the most relevant results first. This concept of relevance is important to Elasticsearch, and is a concept that is completely foreign to traditional relational databases, in which a record either matches or it doesn’t.
